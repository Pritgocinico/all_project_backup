            </p>
            <p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may
                reach our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by

            <h3>
                What information we collect, how we collect it, and why.
            </h3>
            <p>Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:

            </p>

            <p>1. create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name,
                address, credit card number, government identification);


            </p>
            <p>2. request assistance from our customer support team (ex: <a class="text-call-mail-color text-decoration-none" href="tel:+(714)455-1300">+(714)455-1300</a> );
            </p>
            <p>3. complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: <a class="text-call-mail-color text-decoration-none" href="mailto:sales@medisourcerx.com">sales@medisourcerx.com</a> ); or
            </p>
            <p>4. participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we
                promote that might require information about you.
            </p>
            <p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure
                necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we
                thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to
                time).

            </p>

            <p> <span> <b> Cookies and similar technologies </b> </span> on our websites and mobile applications
                allow us to
                track your browsing behavior, such as links clicked, pages viewed, and items purchased.
                Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with our site features or third-party
                features, such as social media plugins, contained within the Services; Internet Protocol (IP)
                address (for example, to determine your language preference; browser type and settings; the date and
                time the Services were used; device type and settings; operating system used; application IDs,
                unique device identifiers; and error data). These technologies also automatically collect data to
                measure website performance and improve our systems, including metadata, log files, page load time,
                server response time to optimize DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations.

            </p>



            <p> <span> <b> Supplemented Data </b> </span> may be received about you from other sources, for example,
                from publicly available databases, social media platforms, or third parties from whom we have
                purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so
                that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the qualifications of a
                candidate for employment, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of
                interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your
                information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to
                us.

            </p>
            <p> <b>How we utilize information.

                </b></p>
            <p>We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only

            </p>

            </p>
            <p> <span> <b> Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services. </b>We collect various
                    information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilize

            </p>

                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services
                and is not linked to any personal information.

            </p>

            <p> <span> <b> Sharing with trusted third parties. </b> </span>We may share your personal information
                with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have
                partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted
                third-party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:

            </p>

                <li>Processing credit card payments
                </li>

                use or retain your personal information for any purpose other than as necessary for the provision of
                Services.

            </p>
            <p>We will also disclose your information to third parties:

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (whether a result of liquidation,
                    bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or
                    buyer of such business or assets; or
                </li>
                <li>if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell
                    some or all of our assets. In such transactions, your information may be among the transferred
                    assets.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p> <span> <b> Advertisements. </b> </span>We want to serve you ads that are most relevant and useful to
                you, so we may use the personal information you provided us in Account Settings or those collected

                site and other sites.

            </p>

            <p> <span> <b> Communicating with you. </b> </span>We may contact you directly or through a third party
                service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as

                offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where

            <p>If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the
                point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies. In addition,
                it will describe any options you have regarding the use and/or sharing of your personal information

                you visit.

            </p>
            <p>If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex. using email marketing services
                to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the contacts and any other personal information for
                the requested service. If you believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and
                you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at

                transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance
                of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or subject to the appropriate standard
                contractual clauses. Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from
                one of our global locations outside your country of origin.

                parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and

                rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop
                activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

            </p>
            <p> To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we

            <p>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have
